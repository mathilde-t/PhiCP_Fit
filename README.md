# Fit Function for Periodic Distributions from Columnflow
### for PhiCP of HToMuTau

A repository to do plotting for HTTCP analysis. The plots can be produced at the end of columnflow, but this repo is for doing plotting from pickle or parquet files. 

## PhiCP - fitting (iminuit)

 - Preliminary : PhiCP distributions are from gen level only
 - cosine function is used for fitting

## Thanks
to Gourab Saha for providing this code for the HToTauTau Channel
