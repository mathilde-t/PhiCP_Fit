# Fit Function for Periodic Distributions and Showcase of their Asymmetry

A repository for plotting in the **HTTCP analysis**.  
The plots can be produced at the end of columnflow, but this repo is for doing plotting from **pickle** or **parquet** files.  

## Produces
- **Cosine fit** for Φ<sub>CP</sub> distributions in the **H → ττ → τ<sub>l</sub>τ<sub>h</sub>** channel for multiple hypothesis 
- **Plots the Asymmetry** between different hypotheses  

## Uses</span>  
- Output (.pickle) from Columnflow

## Thanks 
Thanks to **Gourab Saha** for providing the **original Φ<sub>CP</sub> fit code** for the HToTauTau Analysis:
